README: 

In order to properly set up and install the CvBlobsLib you need to first to download and install the latest version of OpenCV. This version of the library was tested and works on version 2.4.

First set up and install OpenCV 2.4 using the readme that can be found here: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide_Linux
Make sure to run the tests inside OpenCV library after installing OpenCV to ensure that everything is working properly.

Once OpenCV is set up install cvblobs8.3 that can be found in: RoboCupAtWork/raw_3rd_party/cvblobs.

Ensure that you move all the header files (files ending in ".h") to the following directory: "/usr/local/include/cvblobs" in most cases this will require you to make the directory cvblobs before copying the files to the desired location.
